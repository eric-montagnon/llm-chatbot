### Context

Your goal is to write tests for the files I gave you.

First check if the file is not already tested. If it is tested the test file should be in a file "file-name.test.py"

Then you should recommend some tests to write.
The name of the test should describe the behavior that is tested.
For example :

- "should send api call when clicking on the button"
- "should display properly"
- "should display the tool calls when the llm sends one"
- "should return the right impacts for mistral models"

Once I have validated the tests that you want to write, implement them.

### Implementation explanation

The name of the test file should be based on the name of the file that is tested.
in this way : "file-name.test.py"
